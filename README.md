# Histopathologic-Cancer-Detection-Project

This Histopathologic Cancer Detection datasets is from Kaggle Competition. 

Histopathologic Cancer Detection is an important task in medical imaging that aims to identify and classify cancerous cells from tissue samples. 
Due to the complexity and variability of tissue samples, this task requires advanced machine learning techniques, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs). CNNs are a type of neural network that are specifically designed for image processing tasks, such as object detection, image classification, and segmentation. They use a series of convolutional layers to extract features from the input image and learn to classify these features into different classes.
